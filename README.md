Next steps(Sowmesh):
* Improve clustering module: Auto clustering using silhouette score.
* Labelling each cluster as rash, non rash : Rule based labelling: Exploratory analysis maybe using a histogram or smtn: or top highest ranking using kale method: or few shot labelling manually and then use lstm or smtn
* Try improving the accident model. Improve prediction accuracy. One more acci model used.
* Hit and Run: Finish off last step rem, after accident detection.
