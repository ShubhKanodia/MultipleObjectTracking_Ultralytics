Next steps:
* Improve clustering module: Increase number of clusters
* Mark each cluster as rash, non rash. Finish by sunday
* Rash driving detection: gotta test by building some pipeline base work this weekend.
* Try improving the accident model. Improve prediction accuracy. Or trying coming up with some fail safe: like bounding box overlap amt and then based on that some calculations lets see.
